# About the Project

I implement a drag and drop file upload component using Node.js and React.js. The component allow users to drag files from their computer and drop them onto a designated area to upload them. After uploading, the component display the uploaded files and provide options to view, download, or delete them. Uploaded files recorded in the Mongodb database Database and files are saved in the AWS S3

# File Storage (AWS S3)

In this project, files are stored using Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) for scalable and secure object storage. The AWS S3 service allows us to store and retrieve files, such as images and documents, in the cloud. Each uploaded file is assigned a unique key, and the corresponding metadata, including the file name and size, is saved in a MongoDB database.

When a user uploads a file, the project uses the Multer middleware combined with the AWS SDK for JavaScript to handle file uploads to the S3 bucket. Multer is configured to generate a unique key for each file based on the timestamp and a random number. The generated key is used to store the file in the S3 bucket.
